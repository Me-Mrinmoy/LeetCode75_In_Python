1768. Merge Strings Alternately

You are given two strings word1 and word2. Merge the strings by adding letters in alternating order, starting with word1. If a string is longer than the other, append the additional letters onto the end of the merged string.

Return the merged string.

 

Example 1:

Input: word1 = "abc", word2 = "pqr"
Output: "apbqcr"
Explanation: The merged string will be merged as so:
word1:  a   b   c
word2:    p   q   r
merged: a p b q c r
Example 2:

Input: word1 = "ab", word2 = "pqrs"
Output: "apbqrs"
Explanation: Notice that as word2 is longer, "rs" is appended to the end.
word1:  a   b 
word2:    p   q   r   s
merged: a p b q   r   s
Example 3:

Input: word1 = "abcd", word2 = "pq"
Output: "apbqcd"
Explanation: Notice that as word1 is longer, "cd" is appended to the end.
word1:  a   b   c   d
word2:    p   q 
merged: a p b q c   d
 

Constraints:

1 <= word1.length, word2.length <= 100
word1 and word2 consist of lowercase English letters.

class Solution:
    def mergeAlternately(self, word1, word2):
        result = []
        i, j = 0, 0
        # Loop through both strings while there's still characters in either
        while i < len(word1) or j < len(word2):
            if i < len(word1):
                result.append(word1[i])
                i += 1
            if j < len(word2):
                result.append(word2[j])
                j += 1
        # Join the list to form the final merged string
        return ''.join(result)

# Example usage
sol = Solution()
print(sol.mergeAlternately("abc", "pqr"))  # Output: "apbqcr"
print(sol.mergeAlternately("ab", "pqrs"))  # Output: "apbqrs"
print(sol.mergeAlternately("abcd", "pq"))  # Output: "apbqcd"
